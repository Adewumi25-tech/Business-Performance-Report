### INSIGHTS
* Biro would be the product that drives performance, reasons be that it’s the product that had massive profit and revenue for over 2years.
* Notepad and Staplers would be the products that would be discontinued, due to the massive losses occurred over the 2-year period.
* Biro is the product that pays the most tax of approximately ₦151,917.82M, while Marker, Notepad and Stapler pays no tax and are owing tax of about 41.13K,1,064.64K,1,115.67K, respectively.
* Osun and Ondo pays most tax of about 185,25K and 174.34K,respectively, while Ogun pays no tax and is owing 114.14K, reason be that they are at a loss.
* Small Business pays most tax of about 1,363.70k, because of its high profit, while Midmarket and Channel Partners pays no tax and are owing 580.71K & 752.82K, respectively.

## RECOMMENDATION
* There should be more production of Biro, Pencil & A4 Paper, because they have the highest sales and profit.
* The manufacture cost for marker should be reduced ,and more investment on advertisement ,the usage of Marker should also be encouraged, to increase the number of sales and profit.
* Production of Stapler should be reduced, if not discontinued, because the percentage of consumer is low.  
* More investment should be put into the appearance and content	 of a notepad and there should be diversity in how they come. Fancy Diaries for teens should be put into production and pushed into the market. Diversity in production I believe can boost the want and need of Notepad, thereby increasing the Profit and Revenue.

## CONCLUSION
In conclusion, in this Business Analyses Report, we could say there was an increase in general performance, from the year 2013 to2014, also making Biro, Pencil and A4 Paper the most used product, simply because it’s a basic necessity.
Also, the Tax rate across each of the evaluated section wasn’t really poor.
Production rate and manufacture cost should be reviewed and reduced on Markers and Staplers, as they are not a day to day necessity, as the world is going digital, more firms are switching to electronic devices.
There should be more diversity in the production of Notepad, as Notepad(like personal journals and planners) is still a basic necessity……there are people who still like to write.
With the whole analyses, the Business made great Profits and Revenue of ₦11.98M and ₦94.28M respectively, and Profit Margin of 12.70%.
